# iOS 26 Developer Research (January 2026)

## Overview
iOS 26 was released in September 2025, aligning Apple's platform versioning with the release year. The current stable version as of January 2026 is **iOS 26.2**, with **26.3** in beta.

## Key Developer Pillars

### 1. Liquid Glass Design System
The most significant visual overhaul since iOS 7.
- **Visuals**: Fluid, translucent materials that morph and react to touch.
- **SwiftUI Integration**: Native support via `.glassEffect()` and dynamic shaders.
- **Adaptive Accent Colors**: System-wide colors that adapt to the underlying "Glass" material.

### 2. Apple Intelligence (AI)
- **Visual Intelligence**: Developers can now integrate with system-level visual search and screenshot analysis.
- **FoundationModels Framework**: On-device LLM integration for text and image generation.
- **Image Playground & Genmoji**: APIs for generating specialized AI assets within apps.

### 3. SwiftUI 5.0
- **Advanced Reactive Layer**: Automatic dependency tracking similar to modern signals.
- **GPU Acceleration**: First-class Metal support directly within SwiftUI view hierarchies.
- **Spatial Computing**: Deep integration with visionOS 3 for 3D gesture recognition and volumetric windows.

### 4. System Capabilities
- **AI-Powered Battery Management**: New delegate protocols to optimize app performance based on inferred user habits.
- **Live Translation API**: Real-time translation services for audio and text (Phone and Messages integrations).
- **Xcode 26**: New AI-assisted coding, automated UI testing, and performance profiling for Liquid Glass.

## Timeline & Requirements
- **Hardware**: Requires A13 Bionic or newer. Apple Intelligence requires A17 Pro or newer.
- **App Store Deadline**: April 2026 for all apps to be built with Xcode 26 and iOS 26 SDK.
